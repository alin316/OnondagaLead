# Syracuse Lead Violation & Crime Data Visualization

# Intro
This repository is about analyzing the lead violation and crime data provided by the City of Syracuse. What I wanted to do with this data was to visualize it via GQIS Mapping. I thought that visual information was the best way to present my analysis to the general public.
